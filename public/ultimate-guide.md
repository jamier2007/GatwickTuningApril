*Published on December 29, 2023*

Understanding your vehicle's emission control systems is crucial for making informed decisions about potential modifications. This comprehensive guide will help you understand these systems and their impact on your vehicle's performance.

## Understanding the Systems

### DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter)
- **Purpose:** Captures and stores exhaust soot
- **Function:** Reduces diesel particulate emissions
- **Impact:** Can affect engine performance when restricted
- **Common Issues:** Clogging, regeneration failures

### EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation)
- **Purpose:** Reduces NOx emissions
- **Function:** Recirculates portion of exhaust gas
- **Impact:** Can affect engine efficiency
- **Common Issues:** Valve sticking, carbon buildup

### AdBlue System
- **Purpose:** NOx reduction
- **Function:** Injects urea solution into exhaust
- **Impact:** Adds system complexity
- **Common Issues:** Sensor failures, fluid quality problems
